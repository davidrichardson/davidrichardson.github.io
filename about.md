I am a Scientific Programmer at <a href="http://www.ebi.ac.uk"><abbr title="European Bioinformatics Institute,
part of the European Molecular Biology Laboratory">EMBL-EBI</abbr></a>, working in
the Resequencing Informatics team. My current role is to develop software
infrastructure for non-model organism epigenomics projects, such as <a
href="http://faang.org/"><abbr title="Functional annotation of animal
genomes">FAANG</abbr></a>. I previously worked as part of the data coordination team for the
[BLUEPRINT](http://www.blueprint-epigenome.eu/) project.

Prior to joining EMBL-EBI, I worked at the Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute as a computer biologist for the [Cancer genome project](https://www.sanger.ac.uk/research/projects/cancergenome/), and as a software developer for the Mouse informatics group. In both these positions I spent most of my time developing web applications.

When not at work, I spend my time cooking, listening to [Radio 4](http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio4), reading and looking after my two children.
